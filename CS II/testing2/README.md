# Lab - Testing II

---

## Objectives

- Understand test oracles
- Attempt to test a method in _string_ with your tests and using the Oracles
- Use Oracles to create better tests
- Talk about converting to Dynamic _string_

---

## Discussion

- Explain Oracles and how they work
- Using Oracles to create better tests
- Converting _string_ to Dynamic _string_

---

## Setup

We need to:

1.  Create a directory called _testing_2_ in your _cs23001_ folder
2.  Copy the files in `shared/testing_2` to your new directory
3.  Ensure that the provided `string.cpp` and `string.hpp` compile with no errors.

---

## Assignment

- Run the provided `string.cpp` and `string.hpp` against your tests, and try to find and fix the bug in the provided code.
- Use the provided Oracle to find the bug and fix it.

---

## Requirements

The following should be true when you are done, **NAMES MUST MATCH EXACTLY**:

- In your _cs23001_ directory you have created a directory named _testing_2_.
- In the directory _testing_2_ you have the following files:

- The fixed `string.cpp` and `string.hpp` files
- Your _string_ test files

- There are **NO** executables besides the testoracle in the repository.
- Your programs compile, run, and perform as specified.
- Your programs follow the [General Program Requirements](https://data-structures.cs.kent.edu/labs/Info/general_prog_req.html).
