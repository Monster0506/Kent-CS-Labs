# CS2 Lab - Linked Lists and Generics

# Lab - Linked Lists and Generics

---

## Objectives

- Go over Linked Lists
- Go over generics

---

## Discussion

- Standard list is a container that implements a linked list data structure
- Stack is a data structure that can be implemented using a linked list. We'll go over the fundamentals of Stack

---

## Setup

We need to:

1.  Create a directory called _assembler_ in your _cs23001_ folder
2.  Copy the contents of Project 3 into the _assembler_ folder
3.  Write test cases for stack

---

## Assignment

- Create tests for your `stack` for Project 3 Milestone 1.
- The tests should test all of `stack`'s functionality.
- You can run your tests against a static version of stack before attempting the dynamic version.

---

## Requirements

The following should be true when you are done, **NAMES MUST MATCH EXACTLY**:

- In your _cs23001_ directory you have created a directory named _assembler_.
- In the directory _assembler_ you have the following files:

- The files from Project 3
- Your exhaustive test cases of _stack_

- There are **NO** executables in the repository.
- Your programs compile, run, and perform as specified.
- Your programs follow the [General Program Requirements](https://data-structures.cs.kent.edu/labs/Info/general_prog_req.html).
