The overwhelming majority of the execution time (91.3%, 3.62 seconds) is spent within the bubble_sort function and the functions it calls.

The primary bottlenecks are:

bubble_sort itself: Its O(n^2) time complexity means it has to perform lots of operations on such a large input size.
std::vector::operator[]: Takes the most time (40.07%, 1.59s) because it's called over 1.3 billion times by bubble_sort.
LESS_THAN: Takes significant time (16.69%, 0.66s) because it's called ~450 million times within bubble_sort.
SWAP/std::swap: Takes the least time of the biggest (~13.65%, 0.54s) because it's called ~224 million times by bubble_sort.
